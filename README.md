This is a test implementation of a simple Todo List App.
The technologies used for this application are:
 * React as UI library
 * Mobx as state management library
 * Webpack for module bundling
 * Jest + Enzyme for Unit Testing

## How to run the app
Just install with the latest Node.js and navigate to http://localhost:8080.
```bash
$ npm install
```

## How to run the test cases
After you have installed the packages just run:
```bash
$ npm run test
```

## Production build
To generate an optimized production build just run the following command:
```bash
$ npm run build
```
This will generate optimised and minified code in the 'dist' folder. 
Just serve with your favourite web server.
